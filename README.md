SkyLines Tracker
----------------

## What is SkyLines Tracker?

SkyLines Tracker is a location tracking client for the
[SkyLines](http://skylines.xcsoar.org/) platform. Currently it is planned to
run on the iPhone, but iPad support is planned too, once the iPhone version
works properly.

## Features

The project is currently still in its starting phases. As time goes on,
hopefully more features will be added. Currently GitX supports the following:

  * History browsing of your repository
  * See a nicely formatted diff of any revision
  * Search based on author or revision subject
  * Look at the complete tree of any revision
    * Preview any file in the tree in a text view or with QuickLook
    * Drag and drop files out of the tree view to copy them to your system
   * Support for all parameters git rev-list has

## License

The SkyLines Tracker is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license. For more information, see the attached COPYING file.

## Downloading

This application is not yet released in the Apple AppStore or published in any
other way. You can download the source code through git via:

## Helping out

Any help on the tracking client is welcome. The SkyLines Tracker is programmed
in Objective-C, but even if you are not a programmer you can do useful things
like testing this farely new app.
